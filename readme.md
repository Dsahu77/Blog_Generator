# Blogs Generator

## Overview

The Blogs Generator is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to generate blog posts based on a specified topic, word count, and writing style. It leverages the LLaMA 2 model for natural language generation, providing users with high-quality content tailored to their needs.

## Features

- **Input Topic**: Users can specify the topic for which they want to generate a blog post.
- **Word Count**: Users can define the desired length of the blog post.
- **Writing Style**: The application offers different writing styles to cater to various audiences, including:
  - Common People
  - Researchers
  - Data Scientists
- **Dynamic Response Generation**: The application generates blog content in real-time upon user submission.

##Note
Due to limitations in access of resources, I could not deploy this model . I have thus, attached the link to the model I have used, from where it can be downloaded. Once the model is downloaded, save it in a folder called model in the same directory as app.py and after that, if you run my code on your device, you will be able to see the output. Please wait for a while for the blog to be generated as it may take some time, depending on the features of your device. I have also attached the pictures of the website and the responses generated by the website on my device in a pdf folder, please check them out.
