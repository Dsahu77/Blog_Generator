Note: Due to limitations in access of resources, I could not deploy this model . I have thus, attached the link to the model I have used, from where it can be downloaded. Once the model is downloaded, save it in a folder called model in the same directory as app.py and after that, if you run my code on your device, you will be able to see the output. Please wait for a while for the blog to be generated as it may take some time, depending on the features of your device. I have also attached the pictures of the website and the responses generated by the website on my device in a pdf folder, please check them out.
